This is the start of a new journey. My very first project name {Restaurant Menu}.
Currently i'm learning the coding skills from the codex.io.
This is my first project based on cresting a restaurant menu with the help of HTML.
This is the best i can do with my current web development skills.
I hope this is better as a beginner.
